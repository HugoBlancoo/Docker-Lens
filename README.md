# Docker Lens

Docker Lens is an open source project that aims to provide a lightweight, modern web dashboard for easily viewing and managing Docker containers.

It will allow real-time monitoring of active containers and viewing statistics such as CPU, memory, or network usage.

The goal is to combine the power of the Docker Engine API with a clean and intuitive web interface for developers and system administrators.
